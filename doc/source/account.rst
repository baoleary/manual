It is very easy to obtain a project and accounts on FutureGrid. While
it is possible to just execute the three steps in our quickstart
guide, we have provided a more in-depth description based on user
feedback. As you have certain responsibilities including **managing
project memberships** and **reporting results** that must be conducted
while you use FutureGrid. Thus it is a good idea to read this section
more carefully.  At the end of the section we also provided a mini-FAQ
of information that may also be of help for issues you may have
overlooked or have not yet been answered.

.. _s-account-terminology:

Terminology
============

Portal Account:
  A portal account is necessary to communicate information about
  yourself to the FutureGrid team s they can verify that you exist and
  you are a community member with need to use FutureGrid. Once you
  have a portal account approved you can apply for a project.

Resource Account:
  A portal account will not give you access to the FutureGrid
  resources. You will have to go to the portal and join a
  project or create one.

Valid Project: 
  At least one project you belong to must be valid. A
  valid project is one that is approved by a committee. If you are not
  in an active project your access to FutureGrid will be
  blocked. Projects that do not report any progress will be blocked
  after a while. Note that you agree to update us with regular
  results reported via the portal as this is part of your agreement to
  use FutureGrid. 

Uploaded SSH Key:
  As you are using remote compute resources we will require that you
  are very familiar with ssh key management. You will need to upload
  a public ssh key to the portal so we can create you an account and use
  that public ssh key so you log into the resources.


.. _s-account-quickstart:

Quickstart
============

If you have not created a project on FutureGrid before we recommend
that you **do not use the quickstart guide** and instead read the full
documentation. To remind you what you have to do here are a couple
steps that you need to do:

For non XSEDE users:

#. :portal:`Create a Portal account <user/register>` and wait for confirmation via e-mail

#. Join a :portal:`project <projects>` or :portal:`create a new project <node/add/fg-projects>`  and wait for
   confirmation. Note that you must communicate with the project lead
   first before you can join a project.



 
For XSEDE users:

#. Please go to the `XSEDE portal <http://www.xsede.org>`__ and apply for an XSEDE portal
   account.
#. Create a new project as documented in the :portal:`XSEDE portal allocations page
   <ions>` or ask you XSEDE project lead
   to join you to the project.
#. It will take some time to get your account activated

.. _s-account-create-account:

Create a Portal account
-------------------------

In order to utilize **any** FutureGrid resource, you must posses a
FutureGrid **portal account**. Thus, *apply for your **portal
account ** before you attempt anything else. This account is used to
gather some information that we will use in the next steps. You must
make sure that the information is complete before you proceed to the
second step.  FutureGrid performs basic verification of the information
you provide when creating an account, so it may take a little while
before your account is approved. Once you have a portal account, please
proceed.

Please note that you cannot access FutureGrid resources until you
complete the next steps.  

.. sidebar:: |info-image| Hint

   It may take a day or two to get a portal account. Portal
   accounts will not be created over the weekend.

Here are a few tips that make it easy for you

-  On the portal's main page at https://portal.futuregrid.org
   appears
   a :menuselection:`Portal --> Register` :portal:`link <user/register>`. 
-  Following you will be able to **Create a new account** on the
   portal. 
-  Fill in **ALL** fields as much as you can.
-  Note that fields with **\*** are mandatory
-  It is important that you specify your address information completely.
-  If you are a graduate or undergraduate student please fill out your
   advisors contact information in the field specially dedicated for it.
   If he has a FutureGrid Portal name, please also add his portal name
   if you know it in that field.
-  If you have an e-mail address from your institution, we ask that you
   use this address instead of one from gmail, hotmail, or other e-mail
   services that we cannot trace back to your name or institution.
-  Usage of all non institutional addresses will prolong the application
   process.
-  Please note that creating a portal account does not give you access
   to any FutureGrid resources.     
-  Please remember that checking your information will take time. Thus
   we recommend that you wait till you get a message that tells you that
   your portal account has been approved. Then continue to The next
   step. We are not conducting any portal approval outside of 10am-4pm
   EST. If you are easily to be identified your approval will take 1-2
   days, if not, we have either problems verifying your data or
   something else is not right. In case you appear to be a spammer we
   will not notify you. 
     
-  In case you are teaching a class class we have some special
   instructions for you in Section :ref:`s-account-class`.

-  After your account has been approved, you can correct the
   information  as part of the portal account :portal:`User Profile
   Management <my>`.

.. _s-account-create-project:

Create a Project 
------------------

To apply for a new project, fill out the :portal:`project creation form
<node/add/fg-projects>`.  Through this
form we gather some important information about the project so we can
review it for approval. This information is used to report and
document not only to us but also to our sponsors which activities are
conducted on FutureGrid. The more precise you are in your descriptions
and filling out the forms the better we can highlight your
project. Once a project is approved, project members can join a
project.  This must be conducted by the project lead.

The Project PI has agreed to certain reporting requirements to provide
information to FutureGrid. He will be responsible to make sure that they
are completed and also implemented with the users joining the project.
Thus the user is responsible to comply with the terms of the project in
regards to reporting and acknowledgments in case of publications. Each
project PI has the responsibility to communicate such requirements to
the members and managers. The project agreements overwrite the
individuals agreement.

.. _s-account-join-project:

Join a Project
------------------

To join an existing project, ask the project lead or project manager for that
project to add you to their project using that same form. If the project
is set to "accept public join request", you may also send a request in
the portal. To do this, first view the :portal:`project list <projects>` and go to the project
detail page by clicking the project title. If the project is set by the
project lead to "accept join request", then you'll see a large gray
'Join this project' button in the upper right corner of the page. Click
the button to send the join request to the project lead and manager so
they can process your request.

.. include:: account-diag-1.rst

.. _s-account-delete:

Delete or Deactivate a user form a Project
-------------------------------------------

Deletion of a user can be a complex process in case a user has used FG
resources. However, the following is for most project leads
sufficient: To remove a user from your project you simply can edit
your project page and remove the user name from the list of members or
alumni's. If the user is in no other valid project she will no longer
be able to use FG.  If the user really needs to be removed from the
system or from the portal, please fill out the `help form
<https://portal.futuregrid.org/help>`__ with the username and the
reason why he should be removed.  Naturally, if you detect that a user
acts maliciously, please inform us immediately. We will disable
access. Put in your subject line the prefix URGENT.

Reporting Results
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to report regularly results about your projects to
FutureGrid. Please fill out this section and report upon the
achievements of this project. You find your projects in a 

* `list maintained in the portal <https://portal.futuregrid.org/manage-my-portal-account>`__ 

Also upload references that you have produced for this project. You
can upload when visiting your project and using the plus button in
your projects. The reference will than be added and added for you to
the portal.


.. _s-account-closing:

Close a Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Closing a project is an important responsibility of every project
lead.  If you forgot which project you like to close or you have
multiple projects, you can find a 

* `list of projects you lead or manage <https://portal.futuregrid.org/manage-my-portal-account>`__

on the Portal. Once you visit one of them, you have the option to add
results.  Scroll down until you find the section "Project
Results". Please fill out this section and report upon the
achievements of this project.  Please also upload references that you
have produced for this project. In each case, please make sure that
you only upload/report references directly related to this project.
After you have requested a project closing, our project committee will
work with you to make sure we have sufficient results from you. Once a
project is closed all members will be notified. The committee may ask
you for additional results even after the project is closed.


.. _s-portal-sshkey:

Upload a SSH Public Key
======================================================================

In order to be able to log into the started VMs, among other purposes,
you need to provide FG with a secure-shell (ssh) public key. If you are
already a frequent user of ssh, and have a private and public key pair,
it is perfectly reasonable to provide your public key. It's *public*,
after all.

To upload the chosen public key:

#. Copy your public identity into your system clipboard.
#. Visit the `ssh-key panel of your account <https://portal.futuregrid.org/my/ssh-keys>`__.
#. Click the link that says Add a public key.


If you are not familiar with ssh keys we have provided a more
elaborate section about :ref:`s-using-ssh`

Changes to keys will take up to 1 hour to propagate through the system
services. You are not allowed to use password less keys.  Your account
may be deactivated if you violate this policy.

.. _s-account-openid:

Upload an OpenId 
==================

Often users may not remember the pasword or username of the FG
portal. However, they may have an easier time to remember their openid
from for example google. It is possible to use your openid account and
register it once you gain access to the portal. Please visit your 

* `OpenID Page <https://portal.futuregrid.org/my/openid>`__

to add your favorite OpenID. For example, to add your Google OpenId you simply
click on the Google icon.

.. _s-account-using-resources:

Accessing FutureGrid Resources
===========================

To access and use resources, you must have 

- a portal account
- be part of a valid project
- have uploaded a public key to the portal that you will use to log
  into some of its resources.

Once these conditions are met, you will be able to access the
resources and services that your project has requested and been
authorized to use. See the section :ref:`s-services` for a list of FutureGrid
resources and services This includes cloud and HPC resources. Accounts
to these resources will be automatically generated once you have
conducted the above steps. The turnaround time for you getting access
to the system is typically between 30 minutes and one day.


.. _s-account-manage-class:

Manage a Class on FutureGrid
===========================

If you teach a class using FutureGrid resources we recommend you do the following:

#. Create a portal account if you do not have one.
#. Apply for an educational project, carefully filling out the form
   including how many students, broader impact, such
   as support of minorities, what will be learned, the course syllabus
   if available, a link to the course web page if available, the
   duration of the course including a time when the course is
   completed. We typically add a month so that incomplets can be done
   easily. 
#. Make sure you enable the join button of the project, this will
   allow your students to join via a button click and you can easily
   approve or reject join requests. Come up with a "signup code" to be
   shared with the students.
#. Give your students the signup code that you have chosen
   in the previous step. Communicate the signup code to the FutureGrid
   support team via a ticket submitted through
   https://portal.futuregrid.org/help. Make sure you specify your
   project number. Often it is also helpful to send a list of students
   to us s we can assist them easier during the application
   process. 
#. Make sure your students sign up for a FutureGrid portal account and
   that they specify their profile information precisely. This
   information is used later on to grant students accounts on
   FutureGrid. Accounts will not automatically be created just because a
   user has a portal account. Have the students add you as their advisor
   in the advisor textarea.
#. Remind the students to add their public ssh-keys to the
   portal. Some students may not have the knowledge what this means or
   what this is good for. We recommend that you in the first class
   teach the why they need to do this and how the can do this. In the
   portal users can add ssh keys when they go to the my portal
   section.

#. Wait.  It will take some time for the accounts to be created AFTER
   an ssh key is uploaded, and the student is added to your approved
   projects.  Communicate to the students to wait. We only approve
   accounts during business hours and it can take up to 24 business
   hours. Business hours are Mo-Fri 9am - 5pm EST. We will not answer
   any questions on the weekends. 

#. Once a student has an account on the portal, please make sure you
   add the student to your project member. This is important as only people
   that are assigned to a valid FutureGrid project can have accounts
   on FutureGrid resources. Your project will have by default a
   project join request that makes it easy to join your
   project. Provide the link to the students so they join. A
   convenient management button provided for you to verify that the
   student is indeed a person that needs to be in your project. The
   join button can be disabled by you and you could instead also add
   your students by while entering their portal names.

   Hence, You will be able to manage the join of students yourself. Be
   careful that you only join those students that are in your
   class. Please remember that a signup code is not really secret and
   that students may exchange the code with others. Thus it is a good
   idea to still verify if the user with the signup code is a member
   of your class. Also be reminded that some students are forgetting
   to specify the signup code at time of their account creation. You
   have to deal with such forgetful students as a signup code can not
   be added.
#. If the student roster is changing, just edit the project details
   and add, remove them or move them to the alumni status. 
#. If student projects are due on Mondays remind them not to start
   their project on Sunday night and they find out they do not have an
   account ;-) Generally we recommend to make due dates of projects to
   be Thursdays till 5pm or Friday mornings. Be reminded that the
   first Tuesday of each month all machines will be shut down and all
   unsaved running VMs or ongoing work may be lost. Please plan around this.

#. We have created some forums for the three services that you can
   find at https://portal.futuregrid.org/forum. These forums are read
   by the experts and the staff. We can create a forum for your class
   if you like directly on the FutureGrid portal.

#. In case you need more direct support, do not hesitate to ask for
   help https://portal.futuregrid.org/help

#. Make sure you write a results section after your class is over.
