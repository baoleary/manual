Getting Started
===============

In order for you to gain access to the FutureGrid resources, you need to
follow real simple steps:

#. Create a FutureGrid portal account
#. Create or join a project
#. Upload your SSH key
#. Explore our Manual

We will introduce these steps in more detail next.

Step 1: Create a FutureGrid Portal Account
------------------------------------------

In order to utilize \ **any** FutureGrid resource, you must posses a
FutureGrid \ **portal account**. Thus, \ *apply for your \ **portal
account ***\ before you attempt anything else. This account is used to
gather some information that we will use in the next steps. You must
make sure that the information is complete before you proceed to the
second step.  FutureGrid performs basic verification of the information
you provide when creating an account, so it may take a little while
before your account is approved. Once you have a portal account, please
proceed.

Please note that you cannot access FutureGrid resources until you
complete the next steps.  

Here are a few tips that make it easy for you

-  On the portal's main page at
   `https://portal.futuregrid.org <https://portal.futuregrid.org>`__
   appears
   a \ `**Register** <https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/register%20>`__ Link. 
-  Following you will be able to \ **Create a new account** on the
   portal. 
-  Fill in **ALL **\ fields as much as you can.
-  Note that fields with \* are mandatory
-  It is important that you specify your address information completely.
-  If you are a graduate or undergraduate student please fill out your
   advisors contact information in the field specially dedicated for it.
   If he has a FutureGrid Portal name, please also add his portal name
   if you know it in that field.
-  If you have an e-mail address from your institution, we ask that you
   use this address instead of one from gmail, hotmail, or other e-mail
   services that we cannot trace back to your name or institution.
-  Usage of all non institutional addresses will prolong the application
   process.
     
-  Please note that creating a portal account does not give you access
   to any FutureGrid resources, for that you have to complete step 2 and
   3.
     
-  Please remember that checking your information will take time. Thus
   we recommend that you wait till you get a message that tells you that
   your portal account has been approved. Then continue to The next
   step. We are not conducting any portal approval outside of 10am-4pm
   EST. If you are easily to be identified your approval will take 1-2
   days, if not, we have either problems verifying your data or
   something else is not right. In case you appear to be a spammer we
   will not notify you. 
     
-  In case you are teaching a class class we have some special
   instructions for you and after you apply for a portal account you may
   want to get in contact with us via the `help
   form <https://portal.futuregrid.org/help>`__

Step 2: Create a new Project or join an existing one
----------------------------------------------------

You need to either apply for a new FutureGrid project or join an
existing project to use FutureGrid resources. To apply for a new
project, fill out the `project creation
form <https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects>`__. To join an
existing project, ask the project lead or project manager for that
project to add you to their project using that same form. If the project
is set to "accept public join request", you may also send a request in
the portal. To do this, first view the `project
list <https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects>`__\ and go to the project
detail page by clicking the project title. If the project is set by the
project lead to "accept join request", then you'll see a large gray
'Join this project' button in the upper right corner of the page. Click
the button to send the join request to the project lead and manager so
they can process your request.

Once you have been approved to work on a project, you will be able to
access the resources and services that your project has requested and
been authorized to use. See the `project creation
form <https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects>`__ for a list
of FutureGrid resources and services.

Here are a view links that may help you:

-  `Create a new project creation
   form <https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects>`__
     
-  `See the project list to identify the project you like to
   join <https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects>`__
     
-  `Read some FAQs about the account
   creation <https://portal.futuregrid.org/faq>`__

Step 3: Upload Your SSH Public Key(s)
-------------------------------------

In order to be able to log into the started VMs, among other purposes,
you need to provide FG with a secure-shell (ssh) public key. If you are
already a frequent user of ssh, and have a private and public key pair,
it is perfectly reasonable to provide your public key. It's \ *public*,
after all.

To upload the chosen public key:

#. Copy your public identity into your system clipboard.
#. Log into the FG portal \ `https://portal.futuregrid.org/ <../../>`__
#. In the \ **Accounts** menu, select \ **My Portal and HPC
   Account** page. and activate the panel saying **SSH keys**
#. Click the link that says Add a public key.

This step should be fairly instantaneous.

If you are not familiar with ssh key generation, or if you have
difficulty generating a key pair, please inform yourself about ssh keys
or contact us via our `help form <https://portal.futuregrid.org/help>`__
. Detailed instructions on how to generate ssh key pairs will be added
to this document in the near future.

Step 4: Explore the Documentation
  
---------------------------------

Once you have access to FutureGrid resources, a good place to start
learning about how to use FutureGrid are the tutorials, specifically the
following:

-  The \ `Manual <http://portal.futuregrid.org/manual>`__ for detailed
   information

Our manual will include a variety of topics that are of interest to our
users from many different user communities. It would be a disservice to
you to just list a view of them. Hence we provide you with a convenient
link to our table of contents. Please note that the manual also contains
links to our tutorials and our MOOC.

-  `Manual Table of
   Contents <https://portal.futuregrid.org/manual/toc>`__

It will be also easy for you to search for some topics in our search box
at the top of the Web page.


Accessing FutureGrid
====================

To use FutureGrid you must be part of a valid "project". Project
leaders are requested to fill out project applications about the use of
FutureGrid. The
`form <https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects>`__ gathers
some important information about their projects to be conducted. At this
time this information is publicly shared. This information is used to
report and document not only to us but also to our sponsors which
activities are conducted on FutureGrid. The more precise you are in your
descriptions and filling out the forms the better we can highlight your
project. Once a project is formed, project members can join a project.
This must be conducted by the project lead.  A user retains an active
account on FutureGrid when they are in at least one active project. A
user that is inactive does not have to apply for a new account, but
instead apply for a new project. Once that project is activated the user
account becomes active.

Account Management Service
--------------------------

Please note the current process of applying for account may change. 

#. Any user can apply easily for a Portal account: Please go to 

   -  `https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/register <http://portal.futuregrid.org/user/register>`__
   -  it may take a day or two to get a portal account. Portal
      accounts will not be created over the weekend.

#. Once logged in the user has a couple of options

   -  `User Profile
      Management <https://portal.futuregrid.org/manage-my-portal-account>`__:
      Update information regarding the user profile
   -  Project Management: apply for `new
      projects <https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects>`__,
      join existing projects, update information and results of a
      project, manage members and roles of users participating in your
      projects
   -  Managing Certificates and Keys: Integrate OpenID login for the
      portal (with for example your google ID), manage your ssh key for
      access to the HPC service, Manage Nimbus and Eucalyptus accounts
      and keys 

Apply for a Project or Request an Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get access to FutureGrid (FG), you need to register your project in
it. Please go to:

-  `https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects <https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/fg-projects>`__

to apply for a new project. It may take some time for your project to
get approved. No projects will be approved over the weekend.

In case you like to join an existing project, please find the list of
projects at:

-  `https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects <https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects>`__

Clicking on a project title will bring you to the project information
page, where you may see a large gray button on the upper right corner of
the page named 'Join this project'. Click to send join request to that
project. Please notice the PI of the project has to approve you before
you are part of that project.

Some project may not accept external members so there would be no join
button for them. Please notice this behavior is controlled by the owner
of the project.

You can always communicate with the project PI through external channel
of the FutureGrid portal if you know him/her in person by letting
him/her know your portal username. He/she can then directly add you as a
member to his/her project without going through the join request process
through the portal.

Implicit Project Responsibilities for Project Members and PI Agreement for Reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Project PI has agreed to certain reporting requirements to provide
information to FutureGrid. He will be responsible to make sure that they
are completed and also implemented with the users joining the project.
Thus the user is responsible to comply with the terms of the project in
regards to reporting and acknowledgements in case of publications. Each
project PI has the responsibility to communicate such requirements to
the members and managers. The project agreements overwrite the
individuals agreement. 

Cloud Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cloud accounts are handled currently separately from the HPC account
creation process. In fact the Eucalyptus clouds are disjunctive on each
machine and have their own user management. For Nimbus uploading your
ssh key is sufficient. The turnaround time for you getting access to the
system is typically between 30 minutes and one day.

Please be kind and only apply for these cloud accounts if you really
need them.

Key Reset or Adding new Keys
----------------------------

To reset or add a new you ssh key, please update your keys first by
visiting the page

-  `https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/23/ssh-keys <https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/23/ssh-keys>`__

and change the keys as needed. Your reset will take 30 minutes to one
day to propagate through the system services.

You are not allowed to use password less keys.  Your account may be
deactivated.

 

Account Creation
================

Creating an HPC account
-----------------------

All you need to do to obtain an HPC account is to be in a valid project
and upload your ssh key. Typically you will get the account within one
business day. There will be typically no accounts approved in non
business hours including weekends.

Please add your SSH keys in your profile which you can find at:

-  `https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/23/ssh-keys <https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/23/ssh-keys>`__

Once you have done that, please go back to this form and complete it.
After submission, this form will create an e-mail request to FutureGrid.
The FG administrators may contact you to verify this request.

Please, make sure you are a member of a valid project.
 Project IDs can be found at

-  `https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects <https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects>`__

The project lead is responsible for determining if you can be added to
the project.

Note: Do not send mail to FG staff members about joining a project, as
we are not managing individual project memberships

To view your current memberships and status of your account application,
please visit

-  `https://portal.futuregrid.org/manage-my-portal-account <https://portal.futuregrid.org/manage-my-portal-account>`__

Resetting a ssh-key
-------------------

Simply visit the ssh-key page and upload a new key. YoU can optionally
delete other keys if you do n longer need them.

Nimbus, Eucalyptus, OpenStack
-----------------------------

Once you have uploaded your SSH key, the Nimbus, Eucalyptus, and
OpenStack access will be granted. Please visit the manual pages for more
details on accessing them.



Training and Education
----------------------

FutureGrid provides training and educational materials through manuals
and tutorials.

FutureGrid leverages technologies contributed by its partners and by the
open-source community in the packaging, configuration, and deployment of
virtual clusters - including the plug-and-play, self-configuring Grid
appliance, the Nimbus science cloud middleware, the IPOP/GroupVPN
self-configuring virtual network, and the ViNe virtual network.

For links to the initial appliance-based FutureGrid tutorials, see the
FutureGrid \ `Education and Outreach
page <https://portal.futuregrid.org/outreach>`__. Additionally, for
video tutorials on the use of the appliances, see the \ `Grid appliance

Guide to Using the FutureGrid Portal
====================================

Functions of the FutureGrid Portal
----------------------------------

| 
|  The FutureGrid portal aims to:

#. Be the definite source for information about FutureGrid (manuals,
   papers, forums, FAQ, ...)
#. Allow management of your FG accounts (portal, services, and
   resources)
#. Allow management of your futuregrid projects
#. Allow management of FG experiments
#. Allow the dynamic provisioning via RAIN 

A FutureGrid User Dashboard 
----------------------------

After login, you will be redirected to a dashboard-like page (go to the
menu Accounts -> My Portal Account), where you will see the following:

#. A list of useful links, including links to profile, account, SSH key,
   and OpenID management information.
#. A projects summary section that lists the summarized information
   about projects that you are the owner of, that you manage, that you
   are member of, and that you support as a FutureGrid expert,
   respectively. Clicking the project title will bring you to the
   project detail info page. For those projects that you own or manage,
   an 'edit' link is also there so you can quickly update the project
   information.
#. A 'My Content' section where the content that you are responsible for
   maintaining (and/or that you have contributed) is listed. This gives
   a convenient view so you can easily go back to the content and update
   it.
#. A 'My Publications' section that lists your publications.

Update Project Information and Add Results
------------------------------------------

Another frequently used feature is the ability to update your project
information (e.g., add project members) and fill in results in the
'Project Results' section. You can do so only when you are either the
owner of the project or the project manager (if the owner has delegated
that to you). By following the links provided in the 'Dashboard'
section, you can review and edit the project information.

To add a user to your project as a member, the user must have a
FutureGrid portal account first. Then, while editing the project, you
can type a user's first name, and the suggestion feature will pop up
with the user's username to be added. If you have many members to add,
click the 'Add another item' in the 'Project Members' section to add
more. See also `this
FAQ <https://portal.futuregrid.org/how-can-i-add-people-project>`__.

For updating your project results, there is a 'Project Results' section
with a 'Results' window that supports WYSIWYG editing. It supports
simple formatted text, embedded images, etc. For text, you can edit
directly in the window, or copy the content you developed in your
favorite editor and paste the content in the edit window. In the case of
images, you'll need to upload the image to the server first, and then
insert it to the window, or alternatively refer to an external URL for
an image hosted somewhere else.

For more detailed info on how to include an image, please see `this
FAQ <https://portal.futuregrid.org/how-upload-andor-include-image-while-creating-pagenews-etc>`__.

Contribute to the FutureGrid Community
--------------------------------------

The FutureGrid portal also provides its users a place where they can
contribute to the community by sharing their ideas, research topics, FG
experience, etc.; in this way people can learn from you, and also you
can learn from others. Emphasizing user participation and
collaboration is one of the main goals shaping the portal to its current
state.

You can contribute by `creating a 'Community
Page' <https://portal.futuregrid.org/node/add/page-community>`__. You
can find the link in the left side navigation block, under the 'Create
content' menu. After entering the edit page, you'll see a 'Title' text
box, where you put the content/article title, and a 'Body' window where
you put the content. Once again, it supports formatted text and embedded
images, etc.

You can cite FutureGrid references also, by enclosing a citekey within
the 'bib' tag as stated under the editor window (NOTE: Please use '[]'
instead of '<>'), where CITEKEY could be found in the `biblio
page <https://portal.futuregrid.org/biblio>`__ (the content within but
not including the '[ ]').

An example of a user contributed page can be found
`here <https://portal.futuregrid.org/contrib/testexample-page-user-contributed-page>`__.

Using IaaS Clouds on FutureGrid
===============================

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud computing encompasses
techniques that have driven major recent advances in information
technology supporting elastic, on-demand, "pay as you go" computing as a
service. Key technologies behind IaaS cloud computing are resource
virtualization, as well as cloud middleware that enables the management
of clusters of virtualized resources through service interfaces. 

The FutureGrid testbed provides capabilities that allow users to
experiment with open-source cloud middleware and virtualization
platforms, and there are different ways you may want to use these
platforms in the testbed. This page guides you in selecting from
FutureGrid capabilities best suited to your goals, and provides links to
respective tutorials:







Management Services
===================

FutureGrid contains a number of interresting management services. This
includes image management services to deploy and provision images onto
bare metal or virtualized machines as well as experiment management that
allows the creation of easy to use workflows to run repeatable
experiments on FutureGrid. These services are curently under development
and you are welcome to join the development teams by contacting
