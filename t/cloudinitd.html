	<br />
	Its most important feature is repeatable, one-click, deployment of sets of VMs configured with launch plans. &nbsp;These sets of VMs can be deployed over multiple clouds (Eucalyptus, Nimbus, OpenStack, and Amazon EC2 are currently supported), and can also include non-virtualized resources. Like the Unix init.d process, cloudinit.d can

	manage dependencies between deployed VMs. It also provides mechanisms for testing, monitoring, and repairing a launch.<br />
