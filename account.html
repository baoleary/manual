<p>It is very easy to obtain a project and accounts on FutureGrid. While
it is possible to just execute the three steps in our quickstart
guide, we have provided a more in-depth description based on user
feedback. You have certain responsibilities including <strong>managing
project memberships</strong> and <strong>reporting results</strong> that must be conducted
while you use FutureGrid, thus it is a good idea to read this section
carefully.  At the end of the section we also provide a mini-FAQ
of information that may be of help for issues you may have
overlooked or that have not yet been answered.  Some screencasts about this
topic are available in section <a class="reference internal" href="mooc/accounts.html#s-screencast-accounts"><em>Screencast: Account and Project Management</em></a>.</p>

<p>In order to utilize <strong>any</strong> FutureGrid resource, you must possess a
FutureGrid <strong>portal account</strong>. Thus, <em>apply for your portal
account</em> before you attempt anything else. This account is used to
gather some information that we will use in the next steps. You must
make sure that the information is complete before you proceed to the
second step.  FutureGrid performs basic verification of the information
you provide when creating an account, so it may take a little while
before your account is approved. Once you have a portal account, please
proceed.</p>
<p>Please note that you cannot access FutureGrid resources until you
complete the next steps.</p>

<p class="last">It may take a day or two to get a portal account. Portal
accounts will not be created over the weekend.</p>
</div>
<p>Here are a few tips that make it easy for you</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On the portal&#8217;s main page at <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org">https://portal.futuregrid.org</a>
appears
a <em class="menuselection">Portal ‣ Register</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/user/register">link</a>.</li>
<li>Following you will be able to <strong>Create a new account</strong> on the
portal.</li>
<li>Fill in <strong>ALL</strong> fields as much as you can.</li>
<li>Note that fields with <strong>*</strong> are mandatory</li>
<li>It is important that you specify your address information completely.</li>
<li>If you are a graduate or undergraduate student please fill out your
advisor&#8217;s contact information in the field specially dedicated for it.
If he has a FutureGrid Portal name, please also add his portal name
if you know it in that field.</li>
<li>If you have an e-mail address from your institution, we ask that you
use this address instead of one from gmail, hotmail, or other e-mail
services that we cannot trace back to your name or institution.</li>
<li>Usage of all non institutional addresses will prolong the application
process.</li>
<li>Please note that creating a portal account does not give you access
to any FutureGrid resources.</li>
<li>Please remember that checking your information will take time. Thus
we recommend that you wait till you get a message that tells you that
your portal account has been approved. Then continue to The next
step. We are not conducting any portal approval outside of 10am-4pm
EST. If there are no problems verifying your information your
approval will take 1-2 days; if we have problems verifying your
data or something else is not right your approval will be
delayed. If you appear to be a spammer we will not notify you.</li>
<li>If you are teaching a class class we have some special
instructions for you in Section <em class="xref std std-ref">s-account-class</em>.</li>
<li>After your account has been approved, you can correct the

<p>When applying for a project, you may directly visit the project
creation page and fill it out. However, you may find it useful to
prepare a separate (ASCII, or MS word) document and take advantage of
spelling and grammar checkers. Furthermore, as filling out the form
may take some time, it seems best to just copy and paste from your
document into the form. This way you may avoid issues such as power
failures or network interruptions which could cause you to lose the
information that has been entered on the form but not yet submitted.</p>
<p>Examples for a project can be found also on the portal itself

</ul>
<p>Recently we have increased the requirements for project
approval. Hence it is important that you write a couple of paragraphs
in the application.  A single sentence such as <em>I want to learn cloud
computing</em> will typically no longer be approved. Please examine a
sample class project which could be an inspiration
for your own class projects (<a class="reference download internal" href="_downloads/project.txt"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">project.txt</span></tt></a>):</p>

Abstract: *
=========

Note: this is an example project and is not a real project,
although the contents presented in this material is available.

This course will introduce the students at Indiana University as
part of the Summer Semester 2012 into the essentials of Cloud
Computing and HPC. We will start the course by teaching the
students within one week python. As cloud computing framework we
have chosen OpenStack, as it has become one of the ubiquitous IaaS
frameworks and is available on FutureGrid (Sierra). Additionally,
we will teach the students how to program a simple MPI application
so that they can further develop the virtual cluster code available
from github (https://github.com/futuregrid/virtual-cluster).
We will compare the performance between the virtualized and non
virtualized environment as develop with the help of our cloud
metrics system a scheduler that enables us to use bare metal
provisioned clusters and virtualized clusters on-demand based on
resource requirements and specifications. We are aware that the
FutureGrid team is developing such an environment, and like to join
the efforts throughout our course with the contributions conducted
by the students.

Course Dates:

This class will be taught in 10 weeks as part of the Indiana
University CS curriculum. The following dates are important

      Start: July 13, 2013
      End:   Sept 23, 2013
      Extension: 1 month for students with programming in-completes.

Course Outline (tentative):

   1. Introduction and Overview
   2. Essential Python for the Cloud
   3. Introduction to OpenStack
   4. Programming OpenStack
   5. Programming a HPC Cluster
   6. Creating a Virtual Cluster
   7. Performance Comparision
   8. Cloud Metrics
   9. Cloudmesh
   10. Joining FutureGrid Software Developments

Grading Policies:
   Class participation and contribution: 5%
   Homework assignments, reading summary, and paper presentation: 50%
      Programming assignments: (30%)
      Reading Summaries: (10%)
      Paper Presentation: (10%)
   Course Project: 50%
      Proposal: (10%)
      Midterm Presentation: (10%)
      Final Presentation and Demo: (15%)
      Final Report: (15%)

   Note:
     Homework and programming assignments are due by 11:59pm
     Thursdays (unless announced in class otherwise). Late homework
     (non-programming) will NOT be accepted. Late program penalty
     is 10% per day, according to the timestamp of your online
     submission. Only when verifiable extenuating circumstances can
     be demonstrated will extended assignment due dates be
     considered. Verifiable extenuating circumstances must be
     reasons beyond control of the students, such as illness or
     accidental injury. Poor performance in class is not an
     extenuating circumstance. Inform your instructor of the
     verifiable extenuating circumstances in advance or as soon as
     possible. In such situations, the date and nature of the
     extended due dates for the assignments will be decided by the
     instructor.

 Please note that FutureGrid does not approve accounts on the
 weekends. Regular support hours are Mo-Fri 9am - 5pm. Please
 note that answering support questions does take time. Do not
 start the night before the homework is due. Plan your
 programming assignments to be done early.

Intellectual Merit: *
===================

The course will be introducing the students to cloud computing and
will aslo be used to derive new class materiel that we will be
using in subsequent lessons.

Broader Impact: *
===============

This class will be educating a number of students in cloud
computing programming. Cloud computing is an important factor in
job availability after graduation of students, thus this course
will be useful to increase marketability of the students. In
addition we have in tha past also been able to increase
participation of minority students. In tha past we had 10 minority
students and 9 female students taking this class. We intend to work
together with Gregor von Laszewski and improve the FutureGrid
manual and to make our course material available via FutureGrid
through its github and community portal pages.

Scale of use: *
=============

We anticipate the the course will have 30-35 students. The course
will be using OpenStack and HPC compute resources and requires for
selected students access to bare metal provisioning.  The course
will not require to run computationally intense
applications. However, we require that students be able to run up
to 30 VMs at a time. We know that this may in peak hours be beyond
the capabilities of FutureGrid and are advising our students to
kill machines if they are not used. The maximum duration of a
single VM will typically be less than 5 minutes.

<p>Often users may not remember the pasword or username of the FG
portal. However, they may have an easier time to remember their openid
from for example google. It is possible to use your openid account and
register it once you gain access to the portal. Please visit your</p>

<p>To access and use resources, you must have</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a portal account</li>
<li>be part of a valid project</li>
<li>have uploaded a public key to the portal that you will use to log
into some of its resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these conditions are met, you will be able to access the
resources and services that your project has requested and been
authorized to use. See the section <a class="reference internal" href="services.html#s-services"><em>Services</em></a> for a list of FutureGrid
resources and services This includes cloud and HPC resources. Accounts
to these resources will be automatically generated once you have
conducted the above steps. The turnaround time for you getting access
to the system is typically between 30 minutes and one day.</p>

<p>If you teach a class using FutureGrid resources we recommend you do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Create a portal account if you do not have one.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Apply for an educational project, carefully filling out the form
including how many students, broader impact, such
as support of minorities, what will be learned, the course syllabus
if available, a link to the course web page if available, the
duration of the course including a time when the course is
completed. We typically add a month so that incomplets can be done
easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure you enable the join button of the project, this will
allow your students to join via a button click and you can easily
approve or reject join requests. Come up with a &#8220;signup code&#8221; to be
shared with the students.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Give your students the signup code that you have chosen
in the previous step. Communicate the signup code to the FutureGrid
support team via a ticket submitted through
<a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/help">https://portal.futuregrid.org/help</a>. Make sure you specify your
project number. Often it is also helpful to send a list of students
to us s we can assist them easier during the application
process.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure your students sign up for a FutureGrid portal account and
that they specify their profile information precisely. This
information is used later on to grant students accounts on
FutureGrid. Accounts will not automatically be created just because a
user has a portal account. Have the students add you as their advisor
in the advisor textarea.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remind the students to add their public ssh-keys to the
portal. Some students may not have the knowledge what this means or
what this is good for. We recommend that you in the first class
teach the why they need to do this and how the can do this. In the
portal users can add ssh keys when they go to the my portal
section.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Wait.  It will take some time for the accounts to be created AFTER
an ssh key is uploaded, and the student is added to your approved
projects.  Communicate to the students to wait. We only approve
accounts during business hours and it can take up to 24 business
hours. Business hours are Mo-Fri 9am - 5pm EST. We will not answer
any questions on the weekends.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Once a student has an account on the portal, please make sure you
add the student to your project member. This is important as only people
that are assigned to a valid FutureGrid project can have accounts
on FutureGrid resources. Your project will have by default a
project join request that makes it easy to join your
project. Provide the link to the students so they join. A
convenient management button provided for you to verify that the
student is indeed a person that needs to be in your project. The
join button can be disabled by you and you could instead also add
your students by while entering their portal names.</p>
<p>Hence, You will be able to manage the join of students yourself. Be
careful that you only join those students that are in your
class. Please remember that a signup code is not really secret and
that students may exchange the code with others. Thus it is a good
idea to still verify if the user with the signup code is a member
of your class. Also be reminded that some students are forgetting
to specify the signup code at time of their account creation. You
have to deal with such forgetful students as a signup code can not
be added.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the student roster is changing, just edit the project details
and add, remove them or move them to the alumni status.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If student projects are due on Mondays remind them not to start
their project on Sunday night and they find out they do not have an
account ;-) Generally we recommend to make due dates of projects to
be Thursdays till 5pm or Friday mornings. Be reminded that the
first Tuesday of each month all machines will be shut down and all
unsaved running VMs or ongoing work may be lost. Please plan around this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">We have created some forums for the three services that you can
find at <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/forum">https://portal.futuregrid.org/forum</a>. These forums are read
by the experts and the staff. We can create a forum for your class
if you like directly on the FutureGrid portal.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In case you need more direct support, do not hesitate to ask for
help <a class="reference external" href="https://portal.futuregrid.org/help">https://portal.futuregrid.org/help</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Make sure you write a results section after your class is over.</p>
